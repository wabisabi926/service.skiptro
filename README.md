# service.skiptro

Kodi add-on that shows a skip button during TV show intros.

Works with [Skiptro](https://github.com/MikeSiLVO/skiptro-releases), which scans your library and creates `.skiptro.json` files with intro timing data.

## Installation

1. Download the latest zip from [Releases](https://github.com/MikeSiLVO/service.skiptro/releases)
2. In Kodi: Settings > Add-ons > Install from zip file
3. Select the downloaded zip

## How it works

The add-on runs in the background during video playback. When it finds a `.skiptro.json` file next to the video being played, it shows a "Skip Intro" button when playback reaches the intro region. The button auto-dismisses if not pressed (default 10 seconds, configurable in add-on settings).

## Skip data format

The add-on reads `.skiptro.json` files placed next to each video file:

```
TV Show/Season 1/Episode 01.mkv
TV Show/Season 1/Episode 01.skiptro.json
```

```json
{
  "intro": { "start": 0, "end": 87.5 }
}
```

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Auto-close timeout | 10 seconds | How long the skip button stays on screen before dismissing |

## Requirements

- Kodi 19 (Matrix) or later
- `.skiptro.json` files generated by [Skiptro](https://github.com/MikeSiLVO/skiptro-releases)
